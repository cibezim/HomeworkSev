# Notes
Collections Fundamentals: Collections are data structures for storing objects, featuring the Collection interface as the foundation for List, Queue, and Set.

Interface and Implementation: Collection design involves an interface (e.g., List) and its corresponding implementations (e.g., ArrayList).

Common Methods: Essential Collection interface methods include add(), remove(), size(), and contains(), mandatory for implementing classes.

Iterable Interface Extension: The Collection interface extends the Iterable interface, providing functionality for iteration through elements.

List Characteristics: Lists are ordered and indexed collections, with ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector, and Stack as subtypes.

Map Overview: Maps are key-value pair collections, distinct from Lists, utilizing keys for indexing. Common implementations include HashMap, TreeMap, and LinkedHashMap.

Set Characteristics: Sets are unordered collections of unique values, with HashSet, TreeSet, and EnumSet as examples.

Sorting and Operations in Sets: Sets are easily sortable, especially with TreeSet, and support operations like retainAll() and addAll().

Sublist in Lists: Lists offer a sublist() method, allowing extraction of a portion of the list.

Dynamic Resizing with ArrayLists: ArrayLists dynamically resize, offering advantages over regular arrays.

Map Key Operations: KeySet() returns all keys in a Map, and values() provides all values as a List. EntrySet allows iteration through key-value pairs.

Hashcode and Equals in Maps: HashMap and HashSet use hashcodes; objects with equal values must share the same hashcode and slot.
